<h3>Q. So... What?</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> Let's face it, it sucks to get the wrong gift. Ditzy mums, useless partners, interesting grandparents, and even sometimes your closest friends - Sometimes when it comes to presents they manage to go astray. And you've probably made a few mistakes in your lifetime too, even if you thought that look on your dad's face was genuine happiness.
Here at Gift Circle we're putting a stop to bad gifts. How? With simple, useable, fun wishlists that make everyone happy.</p>

<h3>Q. OK, so when's a good time to use Gift Circle?</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> Any time there's an upcoming occasion in which the exchange of gifts is expected!</p>

<h3>Q. Doesn't this take the surprise out of presents?</h3>
<p><b>A.</b> 
In short, no. At no point can you see whether a member of your circle has bought a gift from your list. What you will receive on the big day will remain a mystery until you start unwrapping.
